In this project, I implemented a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in 
Washington state during 2020. I used NumPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python, 
to perform numerical computations and create 2D and 3D visualizations.

The project involved researching and  defining the initial conditions for the population, setting the model parameters 
(infection and recovery rates), and implementing the Euler method to solve the SIR model equations numerically. The Euler
method computes the subsequent values of the susceptible, infected, and recovered populations at each time step based
on their values and derivatives at the previous step.

I created two types of visualizations to represent the simulation results. The 2D plot shows the evolution of the population
groups over time, while the 3D plot provides a unique perspective on the epidemic's dynamics by depicting the trajectories of
the populations in a three-dimensional space.
